Hello. I am a fledging computer programmer operating under an odd name. I figure I'll look back at this name and cringe, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
What I make here is really simple. That's because I'm still learning how to make something worthwhile. 
Whatever you see here is probably me preserving my old creations. Anything here may be used and expanded upon so long as due credit is given. 
I figure that there's a type of copyright licence to use for this, but I'm more concerned with making things than letting it get stolen.
So, feel free to take a look. Perhaps you're a beginner like me looking for something. Well, you've come to a place.
