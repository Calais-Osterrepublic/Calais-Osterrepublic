Hello. I am a fledging computer programmer operating under an odd name.
What I make here is really simple. That's because I'm still learning how to make something worthwhile.
Anything here may be used and expanded upon so long as due credit is given. 
I figure that there's a type of copyright licence to use for this, but I'm more concerned with making things than letting it get stolen.
So, feel free to take a look. Perhaps you're a beginner like me looking for something. Well, you've come to a place.
